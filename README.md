# Dank-Filter
A set of filters for the game Path of Exile 2.

Right now, there is 1 filter, the end game filter.

It will hide alot of nonsense from your screen, while making sure to highlight the
important things.

A few notes:

1) If an item/currency drops, and is not in the allowed list, hit <alt> to show it.
2) Currencies(orbs/etc) that are hidden STILL show on your minimap.
3) Unimportant drops that do show, are shown at a smaller box size.
4) This is an endgame filter for when you get into maps. Using it before than runs
   the chance of missing items unless you pay attention.
